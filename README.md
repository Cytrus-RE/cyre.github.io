## What is Cytrus-RE? 
Cytrus-RE is a rewrite/adoption of [Cytrus](https://github.com/CelestialCrafter/Cytrus) by the [Terrific Tea Studios team](https://github.com/terrific-tea) that aims to fix the issues in it and give it new features, as Cytrus has been abandoned by the owner CelestialCrafter. It also aims to fix the terrible grammar issues behind Cytrus!
