# Contributing 

Thank you for trying to contriibute to Cytrus-RE. Here's a list of resources for you that you could help us out with!
### Code Wizardry
  [Cytrus-RE github repository](https://github.com/Cytrus-RE/cytrus-re)
  
  #### Help us out with Heroku!
  We could have the bot hosted full-time thanks to a generous donation by Commandblock6417. However, we're experiencing difficulties getting the bot running. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/ymZmdaA) and ask Rexo for more info!
  #### Fix bugs! 
  Check the [issues](https://github.com/Cytrus-RE/cytrus-re/issues) page on our GitHub, and patch up the issues you can find there!
  #### Optimize the Code
  CelestialCrafter made the bot, and that also means that we got the cursed code that came with it. Any way to optimize the code will be **highly** enjoyed by everyone
  
### Donations
In case you can't code, [donating](coresites/donate.md) is a good way to keep our things running. This motivates the developers!

### Graphics
In my personal opinion, the blue pikachu logo is unoriginal. We haven't planned out if we should remake the logo or not, but in my (odyssey346)'s opinion it should be remade.
