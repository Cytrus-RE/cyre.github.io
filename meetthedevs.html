        <h1>Hey look buddy, we're engineers. That means we solve problems, not problems like "What is beauty?" Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. We solve practical problems, for instance: how are we going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by us, built by us, and you best hope... Not pointed at you.</h1>
